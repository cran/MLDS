version 0.1-2

  made mlds generic and added default (for glm and optim) and formula
  methods.  The formula method uses optim.

version 0.1-3

  added function df2mlds.df to coerce data frame from results to
  object of class mlds.df with appropriate attributes

version 0.1-5

  modified default DisplaySize in runSampleExperiment
  
  Changed argument N to PntNum in DisplayOneTrial to avoid name
  conflicts due to partial matching

version 0.1-6

  modified LazyData yes

  added aspect argument to runSampleExperiment for controlling
  aspect ratio of graphic display

  graphic display in runSampleExperiment now opens using dev.new
  for better platform independence

  added xlim and ylim arguments to DisplayOneTrial for controlling
  size of displayed scatterplots

  fixed some unmatched braces in Rd files

version 0.1-7

  added as.mlds.df S3 generic

  changed df2mlds.df and ix.mat2df to as.mlds.df.data.frame 
  and deprecated both of the former functions.

version 0.1-8

  modified boot.mlds to use glm.fit so about 2x faster

  fixed unmatched parenthesis in mlds.Rd

  fixed bug in runSampleExperiment in which program bombs if observer
  enters a carriage return instead of a number

  made runSampleExperiment not bomb if observer enters arbitrary character

version 0.2-0

  fixed warnings in mlds.Rd

  eliminated AIC method, relying on default (suggested by Achim Zeileis)

  fixed some non ASCII text in Rd files

  added coef and vcov methods for object of class mlds

version 0.2-1

  Fixed some Rd files that were giving warnings
  
version 0.2-2
  
  Method of triads integrated into package.  mlds.default has
  been removed and now there is mlds.mlds.df for the method
  of quadruples (input objects of class mlds.df or data.frame)
  and mlds.mlbs.df for the method of triads (objects of class
  mlbs.df or data.frame) and generating objects of class mlds
  and mlbs, respectively.
  
  RunSampleExperiment changed to RunQuadExperiment and RunTriadExperiment
  added.  The first produces an object of class mlds.df, as the
  older function did and the latter an object of class mlbs.df

  complementary methods added for objects of class mlbs.df and class mlbs

  mlds.formula method works for mlbs.df objects, i.e., triads, too.

version 0.2-3

  Get6pts wasn't taking into account multiple trials with the same
  quadruples.  Fixed now.

  Get6pts and simu.6pt take a new argument, nrep, which indicates
  how many sessions (complete sets of quadruples) the data represent.

version 0.2-4

  added CITATION file to inst directory

version 0.2-5

  fixed bug in runQuadExperiment example on man page

version 0.2-6

  typos in Rd files

  re-ordered ... arguments to optim in mlds.formula method

version 0.2-7

  added function SimMLDS which creates data from a simulated 
  MLDS experiment

version 0.2-8

  suppressed warnings from boot.mlds, boot.mlbs binom.diagnostics, 
  and simu.6pt and added option no.warn to each of these to turn
  them back on

  made the output of boot.mlds and boot.mlbs lists of class "mlds.bt" 
  and added a summary method to extract the means and SDs.  These can
  be specified to be either on the standard or unnormalized scales

  added defunct function for runSampleExperiment, this being replaced 
  earlier by runQuadExperiment and runTriadExperiment

version 0.2-9

  added vignette

  added Transparency data set
